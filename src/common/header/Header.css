Guidelines for the Login/Logout Button
---------------------------------------
You must use the button component of Material UI.
Its variant should be ‘contained’.
Its colour should be default.
The name for the login button should be Login.
The name for the logout button should be Logout.
You can declare a variable based on the access token value.
You can check which button needs to be displayed here.
It should be on the right of the header.

/* 
Guidelines for the Book Show Button
-------------------------------------------------
It should be a button from the Material UI.
Its variant should be ‘contained’.
Its colour should be primary.
Its name should be Book Show.
This button should always be displayed in the header when a user clicks on a released movie, 
whether they are logged in or not.
When a user is not logged in, clicking the Book Show button would
    open the modal that would ask them to log in/register on the application. 
    If the user is logged in, then it would open the Book Show page, 
    which you can find in the ‘bookshow’ folder, which is present in the ‘screens’ folder. 
    (The code for BookShow is already provided to you. 
    You just need to integrate that with the Book Show button.)
